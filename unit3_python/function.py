# what is a fucncion?
# A function is a set of instructions that will perform a 
# specific task

# there are two variables of fucntions: user-defined functions
#  and built-in functions.

# Built-in functions: instructions that have already been written
# are built-in to the programming language


print('Chris learns coding') # print is a built-in function. we can identifiy functions 
# by the round bracking


name = input('What is your name?')
number = int(input('please type in an number?'))
print(name)
print(3*number)

# all data types, varibles, and operators are just pieces for us
# to use in order to write instructions for functions

# User Defined functions - custom functions created by enginner.

# how do you write a user defined function?
